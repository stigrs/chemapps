# ChemApps - A C++ Chemistry Toolkit 
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/stigrs0020/stigrs/_apis/build/status/stigrs.chemapps?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/stigrs0020/stigrs/_build/latest?definitionId=9&branchName=master)

ChemApps provides a suite of utility tools and programs for thermochemistry
and chemical kinetics.

## Features

* Conversion of Cartesian coordinates to Z matrix
* Conversion of Z matrix to Cartesian coordinates
* Rotational analysis of molecules
* Vibrational analysis of molecules [1]
* Calculation of thermochemical properties for molecules [2]
* Calculation of reduced moment of inertia for torsional modes by using
  the curvilinear scheme [3]
* Calculation of partition function for torsional modes by using the
  CT-Cw scheme [4]
* Calculation of reaction rate coefficients using conventional Transition 
  State Theory
* Calculation of Wigner [5] and Eckart tunneling corrections [6-8]
* Conformer search using an internal coordinate Monte Carlo Multiple 
  Minima (MCMM) technique with uniform usage scheme [9,10]
* Conformer search using a genetic algorithm [11]
* Interface to MOPAC 7, MOPAC 5.022mn, and Gaussian

## Licensing

ChemApps is released under the [MIT](LICENSE) license.

## Usage of Third Party Libraries

This project makes use of code from the following third-party libraries:

* [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
* [qcl](https://github.com/ben-albrecht/qcl) 
* [cxxopts](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts)

Please see the [ThirdPartyNotices.txt](ThirdPartyNotices.txt) file for details 
regarding the licensing of these libraries

The user of this software needs to obtain separate licenses for [MOPAC](http://openmopac.net/index.html), [MOPAC 5.022mn](https://comp.chem.umn.edu/mopac/) or [Gaussian](http://gaussian.com/). 

## Quick Start 

### Requirements

* [CMake](https://cmake.org) 3.4.3
* [Numlib](https://github.com/stigrs/numlib.git)
* [Stdutils](https://github.com/stigrs/stdutils.git)
* [OpenBLAS](https://www.openblas.net/) 0.3.3 (Intel MKL is recommended)

### Supported Compilers

| Compiler      | Versions Currently Tested |
|:--------------|--------------------------:|
| GCC           | 8                         |
| Clang         | 10                        |
| Visual Studio | VS2019 & VS2017           |
| XCode         | 11.4 & 10.3               |

### Obtaining the Source Code

The source code can be obtained from

        git clone git@github.com:stigrs/chemapps.git

### Building the Software

These steps assumes that the source code of this repository has been cloned
into a directory called `chemapps`.

1. Create a directory to contain the build outputs:

        cd chemapps
        mkdir build
        cd build

2. Configure CMake to use the compiler of your choice (you can see a list by
   running `cmake --help`):

        cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" ..

3. Build the software (in this case in the Release configuration):

        cmake --build . --config Release

4. Run the test suite:

        ctest -C Release

5. Install the software:

        cmake --build . --config Release --target install

All tests should pass, indicating that your platform is fully supported. 

>NOTE: Test cases involving MOPAC could fail because of numerical roundoff 
errors in MOPAC on different platforms.

1.  Vibrational analysis of molecules is computed in accordance with the 
    methods implemented in Gaussian (see the Vibrational Analysis Whitepaper 
    available at http://www.gaussian.com)

    implemented in Gaussian (see the Thermochemistry Whitepaper available
